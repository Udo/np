#np

Following the first iteration of np, I'm now experimenting a bit with the Lua 5.2 codebase - to see what np concepts (and other stuff that comes to mind) could be imported into that platform. I made this decision after thinking about a pure C port of the original np proof-of-concept, but why start from nothing if you can start from an excellent and time-proven codebase?

So to make it perfectly clear: this is a playground where I basically mutilate a beloved programming language, step by step turning it into a grotesque monster. This is not for the faint-hearted.
